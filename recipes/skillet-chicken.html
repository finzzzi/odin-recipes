        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>If you love the buttery, garlicky flavor of garlic knots, this dish is about to become your new favorite. Skillet Garlic Knot Chicken combines the same irresistible mix of melted butter, garlic, herbs, and Parmesan, but with tender, juicy chicken.</p>

        <p>"This is exactly the melted butter-garlic-herb combo that gets brushed on top of garlic knots," said recipe developer Melissa Gray. "So flavorful and comes together really quickly!"</p>

        <p>Not only does the sauce keep the chicken juicy and full of flavor, but it practically begs for something to soak it upâ€”think mashed potatoes, pasta, or a crusty piece of bread. In just 25 minutes, you'll have an indulgent meal that's both simple and satisfying.</p>
